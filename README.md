# Optimal control with state constraintd

This documents provide Python code for the experiments conducted in the paper.

## 1. Run 'lagrangian_perspective.py'

It appxoimates optimal control and the state trajectories with respect to is generated

based on our new algorithm

Images of plots will be saved in the current directory.

## 2. Run comparison_lee_c.py'

It appxoimates optimal control and the state trajectories with respect to is generated
